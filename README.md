# Chat.ai

## Description

Chat.ai is a chatbot that can assume the personality of a person given the conversation history of that person. It is built using the [OpenAI GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) API.

The interface is built using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/).

## Usage

To use the chatbot, you must first create an account on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/). Once you have an account, you can create an API key. You will need this key to use the chatbot.

Once you have an API key, you can run the application running the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run Chat.ai.py
```

Inside the application there's a how-to guide that explains how to upload your conversation history and how to use the chatbot.
